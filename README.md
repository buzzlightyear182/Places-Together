Places-Together
===============

**Updated repo [here](https://github.com/buzzlightyear182/More-places)**

Final project for Ironhack Web Development Intensive Bootcamp. Built on HTML5, CSS and Javascript, I used Ruby on Rails and several gems such as rSpec for testing, Devise, fullCalendar. 

A web application platform that allows you to create trips and find companions for your travels. 

1. Search or Browse by city or activity of the existing trips

2. Once you find a trip you like, JOIN the trip (if capacity is not full) and the organizer will be notified by mailer

3. Organizer checks your profile and approves if you can join

4. Once the trip if finished, you review your tripmates and organizer.

5. Reviews and average rating will be reflected on your profile.


Still in prototype stage (I only had two weeks!), and I'm continuously working on this project.
